Spongebob: Hey, Gary! What's up?

Gary: Meow?

Patrick: What's he saying?

Spongebob: I think he's asking why is Mr. Krabs is eating something?

Mr. Krabs: I'm not eating something!

Squidward: Yeah? What are you doing?

Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'm just trying to take a bite of Gary.

Patrick:Wait a second, Mr. Krabs do you realise Gary is a pet not a meal?

Mr. Krabs: But he tastes so good!

Squidward: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! That's not okay, Mr. Krabs! Put Gary down!

Sandy: Haha, this is ridiculous!

Spongebob: Maybe we should just call animal care Mr. Krabs.

Gary: Meow.

Mr. Krabs: Alright, alright. I won't eat Gary. I promise.

Squidward: Thank goodness.
